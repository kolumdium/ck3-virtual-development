## Description
When a county hits the vanilla 100 Development cap, new growth normally stops.  
This mod changes that — instead of wasting excess Development, your counties can convert it into **Virtual Development (VDev)**, which provides stacking, permanent bonuses that scale indefinitely.

Now, VDev comes in multiple specialized types, giving you full control over how your realm develops.

## Features

### 🧱 Five Virtual Development Types
- **Normal**: balanced, mirrors vanilla bonuses  
- **Offensive**: boosts stationed Men-at-Arms damage and toughness in all baronies *(capped at 100)*  
- **Defensive**: boosts garrison, fort level, and defender advantage *(scales infinitely)*  
- **Health**: reduces county danger and improves plague resistance *(scales infinitely)*  
- **Infrastructure**: improves economy, construction speed, and gives control growth *(capped at 100)*  

### 🔄 Flexible Conversion System
- Choose which VDev type to convert surplus Development into for each county  
- Conversion threshold and amount are fully configurable  
- Normal VDev can be converted to other VDev types at a cost  

### 🏗️ New Building Slot System
- Use Normal VDev to **buy additional building slots**  
- Slot cost increases with each purchase but is configurable  

### 🏰 Five Themed Normal Buildings
- Each costs **25 of its matching VDev type**  
- Provide powerful, permanent bonuses that stack with other effects  

### 🧬 New Trait with Progression
- You and the AI gain a **trait** the first time you convert  
- The trait gains XP based on how your realm develops (tracks your specialization)  

### ♾️ Infinite or Capped Scaling
- Buffs are **scalable modifiers**, not flat bonuses  
- Offensive and Infrastructure types are capped at 100; others scale forever  

### 💾 Safe Upgrades
- Updating from older mod versions should work smoothly in existing saves  

## How It Works
- **Yearly check:** Each year, counties above the chosen threshold are evaluated  
- **Conversion:** Development is converted into your selected VDev type  
- **Scaling bonuses:** VDev adds modifiers directly to the county, preserving all benefits while freeing real Development headroom  
- **Building integration:** Accumulated VDev can be spent on powerful structures or new building slots  

## Compatibility & Saves
- **No vanilla overwrites** — designed for wide compatibility  
- **Save-game compatible** — can be added mid-playthrough; updates should work safely  
- **Safe to remove** — removable, though not recommended mid-campaign  

## Configuration
**Game Rules let you adjust:**
- Conversion threshold and amount  
- Building slot cost scaling  
- Chosen VDev type per county (for AI behavior)  

## FAQ

**Q:** Does this change vanilla files?  
**A:** No. It uses scripted effects and modifiers only.  

**Q:** Can I just raise the Dev cap instead?  
**A:** No, the 100 cap is hardcoded in the CK3 executable.  

**Q:** Are the bonuses balanced?  
**A:** They mirror vanilla bonuses but can scale beyond them — so not really.  

**Q:** Can I uninstall mid-campaign?  
**A:** Technically yes, but not recommended.  

## Known Limitations
- The visible Development number will drop when converted, but equivalent VDev buffs replace the lost value  
- Tooltips might not show total stacked bonuses correctly
